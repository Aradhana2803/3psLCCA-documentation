## Part B — Construction Works Data

The **Construction Works Data** section captures all physical materials and quantities that make up the bridge structure. It is organised into four tabs: **Foundation**, **Sub-Structure**, **Super-Structure**, and **Miscellaneous**. Each tab follows the same general layout: a global toolbar in the upper-right corner for bulk operations, and one or more expandable component groups that each contain a standardised material entry form.

> All cost, quantity, and emission values entered here feed directly into the Economic and Environmental pillars of the life cycle cost calculation.

---

### B.1 Foundation

#### B.1.1 Workspace Overview

The Foundation tab captures all structural components constructed below ground or riverbed level. The workspace provides:

- A **global toolbar** (upper-right) with buttons for bulk excel import and trash repository access.
- A **manual entry form** for registering individual material profiles, including structural grading, unit costing, and carbon emission factor data.

### Foundation  Overview

---

#### B.1.2 Bulk Data Import

To populate the Foundation table from a pre-formatted Excel schedule:

1. Click **Upload Excel** in the upper-right toolbar (Download link for excel).
2. Select your  excel filefrom the file explorer.
3. Confirm the import. All valid rows are appended to the component table.

---

#### B.1.3 Trash Repository

To audit or restore previously deleted line items:

1. Click the **Trash** button adjacent to the Upload control.
2. Inside the recycling workspace, click **Upload to Excel** to export the archived records for external review, or click **Back to Work** to return to the active layout without making changes.

---

#### B.1.4 Manual Material Entry

To register a material profile that is not available in the standard database:

1. Navigate to the **Foundation** tab within the Construction Works Data section.
2. Click into the manual entry sub-pane.

Fill in the fields as follows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Custom Material Name** | Free-text name for the non-standard material specification. |
| **Item ID / SOR Code** | Unique catalog identification index or Schedule of Rates code. |
| **Allow Editing DB Filled Values** | Check this box to unlock and modify values that have been pre-filled from the master database. Located directly beneath the identification fields. |
| **Quantity** | Numeric quantity of the material required. |
| **Unit** | Unit of measure corresponding to the quantity (e.g., m³, kg, m). |
| **Rate (Unit Cost)** | Economic unit price for the material. |
| **Rate Source** | Reference for the rate used (e.g., *DSR 2024*). |

**Carbon Emission Factor**

Enter the environmental impact metric for this material:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Emission Factor per Unit (kgCO₂e)** | Quantitative carbon footprint multiplier per unit of material. |
| **Source** | Verification origin for the emission factor (e.g., inventory database or regulatory publication). |

**Recyclability**

To account for end-of-life recovery:

- Activate the **Include** checkbox within the Recyclability parameters sub-section. This enables the material to contribute to the Environmental pillar's end-of-life recovery calculation.

**Material Classification**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Grade** | Structural grade designation (e.g., *M25*, *Fe500*). |
| **Type** | Material category selected from the dropdown list (e.g., *Concrete*, *Steel*). |

---

#### B.1.5 Saving or Discarding the Entry

Once all fields are complete, choose one of the three bottom actions:

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Save to Custom DB** | Commits the material profile permanently to the regional library for reuse across future projects. |
| **Add to Table** | Appends the row strictly to the current project — the profile is not saved to the library. |
| **Cancel** | Discards all inputs and closes the manual entry form without saving. |

> To remove an existing component from the table, click **Delete Component** on the corresponding row.

---

### B.2 Sub-Structure

#### B.2.1 Workspace Overview

The Sub-Structure tab captures all structural elements built above ground level that support the bridge deck. It tracks four explicit components: **Piers**, **Pier Caps**, **Pedestals**, and **Bearings**.

The workspace is structured in two tiers:

- A **global toolbar** (upper-right) that applies bulk actions across all four components simultaneously.
- **Per-component controls** — each component group contains its own **Add Material** and **Delete Component** buttons for localised management.

### Sub-Structure Overview

---

#### B.2.2 Global Component Management

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Upload Excel** (global) | Executes bulk data onboarding for all four components simultaneously from a single formatted Excel file. |
| **Trash** (global) | Opens the recycling workspace to audit or restore deleted structural line items across all components. |

---

#### B.2.3 Per-Component Actions

Within the Sub-Structure control tree, each component group (Pier, Pier Cap, Pedestal, Bearings) provides:

- **Add Material** — initialises a new material entry row within that component.
- **Delete Component** — removes the entire component group from the active calculation.

### B.6 Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I import data for only one component instead of all components at once?**
The global **Upload Excel** button imports data across all components simultaneously. To populate a single component, use the per-component **Add Material** button and enter values manually.

**Q: What does "Allow Editing DB Filled Values" do?**
Some fields are pre-filled from the master material database and locked to prevent accidental overrides. Checking this box unlocks those fields for the current entry session only — it does not permanently alter the database.

**Q: What is the difference between "Save to Custom DB" and "Add to Table"?**
**Add to Table** adds the material only to the current project. **Save to Custom DB** writes it to your organisation's local library, making it available for selection in all future projects without re-entering the details.

**Q: Which components support the Recyclability and Carbon Emission Factor fields?**
All components across Foundation, Sub-Structure, Super-Structure, and Miscellaneous support both fields. The fields are conditional — they remain hidden until the corresponding checkbox is selected.

**Q: I deleted a material row by mistake. Can I recover it?**
Yes. Click the **Trash** button in the upper-right toolbar to open the recycling workspace. Deleted items are held there and can be reviewed, exported, or restored.
